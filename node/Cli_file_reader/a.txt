The Forgotten Lighthouse

The old lighthouse stood alone on the cliff, its once-bright beam now dimmed by years of neglect. Fishermen claimed it was haunted, whispering stories of a keeper who had vanished one stormy night. But to young Mara, it was simply a mystery waiting to be solved. She often climbed the winding path, drawn by the eerie silence and the way the wind howled through its broken windows.

One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, Mara found a rusted key half-buried in the sand. It fit perfectly into the lighthouse’s ancient lock. Inside, the air was thick with dust, and the spiral staircase groaned under her weight. At the top, she discovered a journal—its pages brittle with age—filled with frantic entries about strange lights in the fog.

The last entry was dated the night the keeper disappeared. "They’re not stars," it read. "They’re watching. And now they know I’ve seen them." A chill ran down Mara’s spine as she realized the beam hadn’t failed—it had been covered from the outside. Scratches marred the glass, too high for any human to reach.

She never returned to the lighthouse. But sometimes, on foggy nights, villagers swear they see a flicker from the tower—a brief, unnatural glow that doesn’t match any ship’s lantern. And those who listen closely claim to hear a faint, metallic tapping against the glass.

The journal remains hidden in Mara’s drawer. She won’t burn it, but she won’t open it again either. Some doors, once unlocked, should stay closed.
